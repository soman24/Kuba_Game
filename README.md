Introduction

This project is an implementation of the board game callde Kuba. The primary purpose of this project was to refine my OOP skills.

A quick summary of the Kuba board game:

Game ends when a player wins. A players wins by pushing off and capturing seven neutral red stones or by pushing off all of the opposing stones. A player who has no legal moves available has lost the game.

Any player can start the game.

The initial setup of the board will be as shown in the figure in the kuba game rules website.

Rules to move a marble:
- You need an empty space(or the edge of the board) on the side you are pushing away from. 
- A player cannot undo a move the opponent just made (if it leads to the exact same board position)
